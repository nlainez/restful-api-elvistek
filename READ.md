# elvis-tek-store
This challenge is designed to put my NodeJS skills to the test by creating a Rest API to manage a small snacks store called Elvis.

# Install node.js before installing this webapp
You can fallow the instructions en the following link:

# Installing Elvis Tek Store App
In order to install this app, you can download the zip containing all the webapp, or by cloning the repo through any git client.
If you download a zip, uncompress in you prefered location in you machine.

Then open a command prompt, and go to the location where you have the app files, then run this command:
   npm install
   
Once you do that, you just have to run this other command
   nodemon

After you see the message: "elvisTekStore running on port: 3000", you can go to this link, in your browser, and the app should be already running.
http://localhost:3000/
